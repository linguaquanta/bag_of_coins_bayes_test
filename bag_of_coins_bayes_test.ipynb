    "In this case, the Bayesian estimate wins. Thus, we can see that the frequentist and Bayesian approaches each have their own place depending on the context. In the first experiment, since the tosses are independent, waiting until we observe the first toss has no affect on the probability. In the second experiment, however, we re-sample the coin from the bag until the first toss outcome is heads. It is this crucial step of re-sampling from the bag until the first heads outcome that produces the Bayesian result."
